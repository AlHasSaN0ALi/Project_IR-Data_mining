# Project_IR-Data_mining
Data mining and information retrieval project to build a search engine application! ( Academic Project )

🔍 Project Overview:

▫ Implemented sophisticated data preprocessing techniques, including tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming, to clean and prepare the dataset.

▫ Information Retrieval: Leveraged Python Terrier to index and retrieve documents using models like TF-IDF and BM25, enhancing search relevance.

▫ Query Expansion: Utilized RM3 for query expansion to improve retrieval performance.

▫ Web Deployment: Developed a search application using Flask and ngrok, allowing for seamless query processing and result display.

▫ Advanced Embeddings: Integrated ELMo embeddings to improve text understanding and similarity measures.

💡 Key Features:

▫ Comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline.

▫ Robust indexing and retrieval mechanisms for high-quality search results.

Interactive web interface for a user-friendly search experience.
